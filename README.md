# Trading-Simulator
An algorithmic stock trading simulator program. Uses Yahoo finance data sets to calculate profits that would be made if my trading algorithm bought stocks in real life and stores all the relevant information in a database.

Every 5 days, my algorithm (portolio rebalancing) rebalances the portfolio of stocks that were purchased the week before. This means that every 5 days, the web site will display a new transaction order, total balance, average investment return and more... This project uses flask and a web hosting website called PythonAnywhere.


Show below is what the databse looks like (It contains test data).
