# Trading-Simulator
A stock trading simulator program. Uses Yahoo finance data sets to calculate profits that would be made if you invested in real life and stores all the relevant information in a database.


Here is an example of the database. The data in the database is wrong because it was ran with 10 second intervals for 60 seconds instead of 5 day intervals. It should give you an idea of what it's doing though. It takes the 3 worst performing stocks and replaces them with the better performing stocks of a pool. Since this is only a simulation, I made it so there is $5000 invested equally in each selected stock. The profit is simply the added percentage returns of each stock in the porfolio that week.

Show below is the website which displays the financial information stored in the database.
